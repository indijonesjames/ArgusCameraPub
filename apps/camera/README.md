# Argus Camera Application

## Overview


## Design

The main design goal was to create a modular camera application that would work with Framos cameras. Functionality like video recording
or image capturing is encapsulated in modules which easily can be added to the application.
There is a central entity, the 'Dispatcher', managing the state, like the current device, sensor
mode and many others. The 'Dispatcher' also provides functionality to simplify using Argus from
the modules.

Directory structure

common
    Shared functionality like mutex, timing, conditional variable. The app also uses shared
    code from the 'samples/utils' directory.
modules
    Functional entities, includes the Dispatcher, XML config file reading/writing, perf tracking.
modules/tasks
    Tasks provide functionality like image capturing or video recording.
renderer
    Provides support for rendering and composing EGL streams.
ui
    User interface implementations, includes command line and GUI code.
ui/camera
    Camera main application code.
ui/capture
    Capture application module UI implementation.
ui/common
    Base application and application module classes.
ui/gallery
    Gallery application module UI implementation.
ui/multiExposure
    Multi exposure application module UI implementation.
ui/multiSession
    Multi session application module UI implementation.
ui/video
    Video application module UI implementation.

## Usage
